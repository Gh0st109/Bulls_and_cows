# Bulls_and_cows
This is just a game that I made
while I was learning how to code in C++
Also, to play the game, you may need visual
studio 2019 and it should also be installed with 
c++

# How to set up the game 
To set up the game, you may need Visual Studio to run
the game. To make the game, go into visual studio, 
click on create a new project, click on console application, 
give the project any name you want after that, click on
create. After you created the project, click on
source files, delete the .cpp file that is in the
that folder and right click on source files,
move your cursor towards add and after that, click
on existing item and add the three files that you've
downloaded

Again this is just a game that I made while I was
learning how to code in c++ so this game may not be
good.
